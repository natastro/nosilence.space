Project created as an accessible resource to aid the black community. There are multiple masterlists for different ways to support this community and to remove the injustices that have been inflicted upon them for years. There are funds to donate to for families that have lost someone to police brutality, bail funds for protests, multiple organizations that call for change, petitions that need signed, resources to contact district attorneys and state representatives, mental health resources (general and centered to the community), artists and individuals to support, professional organizations and more.
